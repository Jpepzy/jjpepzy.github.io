<h1> Mitigating corporate information exposure on the web </h2>


<p>
Now that companies both large and small are relying on all sorts of information to keep their businesses running, the need to protect and secure these sensitive bits of data has become increasingly paramount. The risk of information exposure needs to be assessed and reduced and the first point of call for this task is normally the one most overlooked by corporations, i.e  understanding what it means to be exposed to both internal and external threats. To do this a few critical questions need to be asked, for example; how vulnerable or susceptible is the data to being breached, who is going to have access to it? Where will the most sensitive information be stored, is it classified accurately, what data protection plans have been applied to it, and what measures have been put in place to protect it. What critical or sensitive information is exposed to internal and/or external threats, which threat poses the greatest risk to the company as a whole and should the information be protected against these threats.</p>

<p>Any company that can confidently answer these questions will gain a decent insight into the level at which they risk their information being exposed and can the begin to implement measures towards the mitigation of said risk. Companies seem to think that pumping more money into security management is a one shot solution to data breaching but that couldn’t be further from the truth. External cybercriminals aren’t the only ones that need an eye kept on, threats to information security aren’t limited to just them. Companies must also act to protect its data against the threat from insiders.  Be them dubious employees who deliberately expose valuable information for personal gain,or unwitting employees who mistakenly put the company at risk. Once companies recognise the kind of risk they face, understand and acknowledge the exposure of their information to internal and external data breaches, they can then begin to measure actual data loss across the mainframe. They can begin to assess, evaluate, review and identify the most valuable information and data asset they possess. Prioritizing the most sensitive of them so that the way the data is being used across the company can be discovered, after that, all the applications that are associated with the information, key systems, endpoints and networks can be pinpointed and analysed for the vulnerabilities and data loss risks. Only then can a company form a plan that meets the need of both internal and external threats.</p>  

<p>Each company needs to run with the expectation that they are going to be hacked  and not wait comfortably behind a layers of security. It’s no longer a matter of stopping the breach, it’s now a matter of mitigating the breach when it happens. The first step that can be take towards that identifying critical information and systems, this can be done by setting up key information classification levels, namely public, private, confidential and in some cases top secret. The company can then assign specific information to specific categories, for example, marketing plans, payroll, network configurations, external communications and others to their appropriate levels. After this the company can then decide who is granted access to it, where it is stored and where i can be sent to, and most importantly how it can be protected. Same can be applied to internal file sharing, from email servers to databases, transaction servers to web servers.</p>
