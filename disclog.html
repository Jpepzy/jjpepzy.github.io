Welcome to the Discovery Log

<h2>Week 1</h2>
<p>Being the first week week it was pretty non technical, learnt about the web, what it is, what it does, the skills you need to delve in. Learnt that all my lecturers are have a doctorate, this may seem irrelevant to the simple man but it contributes to my study on the relationship between beards and techy Phds.

Time management is key as well, its a transferable skill that everyone needs to have, in fact there’s a youtube video of a girl who talks about about time management we watched and in one video she was just studying and encouraged us to learn with her….weird
</p>
<h2>Week 2</h2>
<p>Discovered how to favourite a page on  moodle, will try and figure out how to do that on my own webpage one day. Also learnt about the Virtual Machine the school runs, not entirely sure how it runs or how to start it up but we live and learn each day. One easier concept was text editors, there’s literally way too many. Im sticking with notepad ++ because the logo is a sexy chameleon. Finally, a little sneak peek into how scary the web can actually be, stay tuned for more next week</p>
<h2>Week 3</h2>
<p>Learnt a new word “Erudite” which i’m sure i’ll never use it my life but hey you never know when you need to impress some babe. It would be better to impress her with Web Security which we learnt this week. Without realizing it we put a lot of sensitive data out there, names , addresses, you name it. We formed groups and came up with what possible data we might have uploaded and how sensitive they are, categorizing them along the way. This was also the first time we encountered Dr. Nick Savage, funny last name i thought but then apparently its an alias….go figure.</p>
<h2>Week 4</h2>
<p>First thing i want to say is that when you give multiple people access to one document..memes and chaos ensues. Ashamed to say it took me 4 weeks to discover that the university actually has an online library which is actually very resourceful, not so confusing to use but it will take some getting used to. The reason for this being our first coursework, literature review. Academic writing is quite complicated, so many dos and don'ts, so many shoulds and should nots. But at least i feel my grammar has improved a little.</p>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<p>Nothing much new this week, just an expansion on academic writing, i already write novels and stuff so this week kinda serves to polish up my skills i guess. Lynda.com is basically a treasure chest for students once you have a .ac.uk email.</p>
<h2>Week 6</h2>
<p>Yaaaaas finally on html, this is what i was looking forward to most. Although i should have known this i discovered it runs on binay as well, binary is everything man. Putting our editors to use i found the required elements that make an ordinary file an html, a few other elements were discussed. Also figured out how to use the schools virtual machine, uploading files and stuff to the server and voila, my page is live. Also IE keeps letting me down but  refuse to give up on it, i say this since it needs something called ssh to run which chrome already has installed</p>
<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p>Submission week for the literature review, so tired.</p>
<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>New markup this week, CSS, stands for cascading style sheets for those who don’t know. Its basically a seperate sheet for styling your website so that your html doesn’t get too messy. Plus you type it once in CSS and it applies all the way down your html, probably why the name cascading. The star wars crawl sequence was recreated in one of the lectures which was pretty cool, not that much work or coding was needed. More elements were introduced like divs and article and sections all which play their own role. There was this thing called inheritance and im not entirely sure what its supposed to do but i’ll practice that later</p>
<h2>Week 9</h2>
<p>This week was a reminder that we no longer live in the stone age, the editors are pretty light weight but can do soo much. It’s actually made making websites a whole lot easier with all the shortcuts and cursor tricks and hacks. The editor atom is open source so its continuously being improved by a large community meaning if you are feeling too lazy you could either talk to the community or get up and make some changes that would make certain parts of coding easier. Plus there’s this thing called WinSCP and that’s used to connect your files to the VM.</p>
<h2>Week 10</h2>
<p>So now we know how to make a website we need to know what to do with that information, here comes the design element, what to do with what we know how to do. It’s all about simplicity and getting the message across. Interactivity is also key apparently and also information assimilation, focus on layout also because people don’t want to leave your website with a headache. Most important of all, understanding user requirements, knowing what your viewers want/need is vital to making a proper website.</p>
<h2>Week 11</h2>
<p>Pictures! Yeah no one likes to read anymore so now it’s all about letting your image speak a 1000 words, the world of CSS just keeps getting bigger and bigger, there’s so much you can do with so little html. New tags learnt will all be explained in the summary. Also found about about this web site called github and its introduced me to such a wider community, people actually sharing ideas and improving </p>
